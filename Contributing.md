## Some points to know
We use Flask as the Framework, along with applications related to Flask. The deployment is done via Travis CI to heroku.  Github Search is a testing and initial Project to enable better searching of the Github Repos, as it becomes nasty for the newbies to use Github or look for the Projects.

## Who can contribute

One with Flask along with Python is a must for getting to understand the code. The structure is inspired by [repo](https://github.com/imwilsonxu/fbone).
